This is an example app to demonstrate the use of @def/test-utils test helpers to test an angular application in all levels:
- Component (Testing a component in  the browser)
- Integration (Testing the entire Front End while intercepting http requests and mocking Back End responses)
- E2E

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.11.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running component tests & integration tests

Run `npm run cy:open` to execute the tests via Cypress.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run cy-e2e:open` to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress
